Description: Cybersecurity Incident Documentation
The cybersecurity incident can be divided into two distinct phases:

Detection and Analysis:
During this phase, the organization initially identified the presence of the ransomware incident. To analyze the situation, they sought technical assistance from multiple organizations to better understand the nature and extent of the attack.

Containment, Eradication, and Recovery:
The subsequent phase focused on containing the incident and initiating recovery procedures. As a containment measure, the company decided to shut down their computer systems. However, due to the complexity of eradicating and recovering from the incident, they collaborated with various external organizations for additional expertise and support.

Tools used:none

The 5 W's :  ● Who: An organized group of unethical hackers
● What: A ransomware security incident
● Where: At a health care company
● When: Tuesday 9:00 a.m.
● Why: The incident happened because unethical hackers were able to
access the company's systems using a phishing attack. After gaining
access, the attackers launched their ransomware on the company's
systems, encrypting critical files. The attackers' motivation appears to
be financial because the ransom note they left demanded a large sum
of money in exchange for the decryption key.
